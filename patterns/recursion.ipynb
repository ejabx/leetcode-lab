    "# How Recursion Works and When to Use It\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Recursion Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller versions of the same problem. Think of it like Russian nesting dolls - each doll contains a smaller version of itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Components of Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base Case**: The stopping condition that prevents infinite recursion. This is the simplest version of the problem that can be solved directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recursive Case**: The function calls itself with a modified input, gradually working toward the base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Call Stack**: Each recursive call gets added to the stack. When a base case is reached, the calls start returning and \"unwinding\" from the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Recursion Works in Linked List Reversal\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's trace through a simple example with list: 1 → 2 → 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The key is to work backwards. Assume that the rest of the list had already been reversed, now how do we reverse the front part?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Call 1**: reverse(1 → 2 → 3)\n",
    "   - Not base case, so call reverse(2 → 3)\n",
    "2. **Call 2**: reverse(2 → 3)  \n",
    "   - Not base case, so call reverse(3)\n",
    "3. **Call 3**: reverse(3)\n",
    "   - Base case reached (next is null), return 3\n",
    "4. **Unwinding**: Now we reverse the connections\n",
    "   - Call 2: Make 3 point to 2, return 3\n",
    "   - Call 1: Make 2 point to 1, return 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: 3 → 2 → 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Good Use Cases:\n",
    "- **Tree/Graph traversal** - Natural hierarchical structure\n",
    "- **Divide and conquer** - Problems that break into similar subproblems\n",
    "- **Mathematical sequences** - Fibonacci, factorials\n",
    "- **Backtracking** - Finding all solutions by trying possibilities\n",
    "- **Parsing nested structures** - JSON, XML, parentheses matching\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule of thumb**: Use recursion when the problem naturally breaks down into smaller versions of itself, and the depth won't be too large. Use iteration when you need optimal performance or are dealing with very large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When __Not__ To Use Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deep call stacks** - Risk of stack overflow\n",
    "- **Simple iteration works** - Don't overcomplicate\n",
    "- **Performance critical** - Function call overhead\n",
    "- **Tail recursion not optimized** - Some languages don't optimize this\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Large Input Size Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Programming with Large Constraints\n",
    "- Problems with n ≤ 10^5 or larger\n",
    "- Fibonacci-like sequences with large numbers\n",
    "- Grid traversal problems (like unique paths in large grids)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why recursion fails:** Stack overflow from deep recursion. A problem asking for the 100,000th Fibonacci number would crash with naive recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example scenario:** Calculate number of ways to climb stairs with n = 50,000 steps.\n",
    "- Recursive: Stack overflow\n",
    "- Iterative/DP: Works fine\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. String/Array Processing with Linear Depth\n",
    "\n",
    "### Palindrome Checking on Very Long Strings\n",
    "- Strings with length 10^4 or more\n",
    "- Each recursive call processes one character\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linked List Problems with Long Lists\n",
    "- Reversing a linked list with 10^5 nodes\n",
    "- Finding middle element of very long list\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why recursion fails:** Each node creates a new stack frame, leading to O(n) space complexity and potential stack overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Tree Problems with Extreme Depth\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highly Unbalanced Binary Trees\n",
    "- Trees that are essentially linked lists (all nodes have only one child)\n",
    "- Tree depth approaches 10^4 or more\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Tree traversal where the tree looks like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    " \\\n",
    "  2\n",
    "   \\\n",
    "    3\n",
    "     \\\n",
    "      ... (10,000 nodes deep)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why recursion fails:** Stack depth equals tree depth, causing overflow.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Maze Solving\n",
    "- Very large mazes where the solution path is extremely long\n",
