    "# Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Linked List?\n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list is a linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are stored in a sequence, but unlike arrays, elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Node Structure\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Data | Next] -> [Data | Next] -> [Data | Next] -> NULL\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node contains:\n",
    "- **Data**: The actual value stored\n",
    "- **Next**: A pointer/reference to the next node\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Node Implementation (JavaScript)\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Node {\n",
    "    constructor(data) {\n",
    "        this.data = data;\n",
    "        this.next = null;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Singly Linked List\n",
    "- Each node points to the next node\n",
    "- Traversal only possible in one direction (forward)\n",
    "- Last node points to NULL\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Doubly Linked List\n",
    "- Each node has pointers to both next and previous nodes\n",
    "- Bidirectional traversal possible\n",
    "- Requires more memory per node\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Circular Linked List\n",
    "- Last node points back to the first node\n",
    "- No NULL termination\n",
    "- Can be singly or doubly circular\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Insertion\n",
    "- **At beginning**: O(1) time complexity\n",
    "- **At end**: O(n) time complexity (unless you maintain tail pointer)\n",
    "- **At specific position**: O(n) time complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Deletion\n",
    "- **From beginning**: O(1) time complexity\n",
    "- **From end**: O(n) time complexity\n",
    "- **Specific node**: O(n) time complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Search\n",
    "- **Time complexity**: O(n)\n",
    "- Must traverse from head to find element\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Traversal\n",
    "- **Time complexity**: O(n)\n",
    "- Visit each node sequentially\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages vs Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Linked Lists:\n",
    "- **Dynamic size**: Can grow/shrink during runtime\n",
    "- **Memory efficient**: Only allocates memory as needed\n",
    "- **Easy insertion/deletion**: At beginning is O(1)\n",
    "- **No memory waste**: No unused allocated space\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages of Linked Lists:\n",
    "- **No random access**: Must traverse from head\n",
    "- **Extra memory**: Requires storage for pointers\n",
    "- **Not cache-friendly**: Nodes scattered in memory\n",
    "- **No backward traversal**: In singly linked lists\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Interview Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Reverse a Linked List\n",
    "- **Approach**: Use three pointers (prev, current, next)\n",
    "- **Time**: O(n), **Space**: O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Detect Cycle\n",
    "- **Floyd's Algorithm**: Use slow and fast pointers\n",
    "- **Time**: O(n), **Space**: O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Find Middle Element\n",
    "- **Two-pointer technique**: Slow pointer moves 1, fast moves 2\n",
    "- **Time**: O(n), **Space**: O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Merge Two Sorted Lists\n",
    "- **Approach**: Compare nodes and link smaller one\n",
    "- **Time**: O(n + m), **Space**: O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Remove Duplicates\n",
    "- **Sorted list**: Single pass comparison\n",
    "- **Unsorted list**: Use hash set or sort first\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Linked List Class\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class LinkedList {\n",
    "    constructor() {\n",
    "        this.head = null;\n",
    "        this.size = 0;  // Optional: track size\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    insertAtBeginning(data) {\n",
    "        const newNode = new Node(data);\n",
    "        newNode.next = this.head;\n",
    "        this.head = newNode;\n",
    "        this.size++;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Management\n",
    "- JavaScript handles garbage collection automatically\n",
    "- No need to manually free memory like in C/C++\n",
    "- Always update pointers carefully to avoid losing references\n",
    "- Set removed nodes to null to help garbage collection\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "### Good for:\n",
    "- Frequent insertions/deletions at the beginning\n",
    "- Unknown or highly variable data size\n",
    "- Implementing other data structures (stacks, queues)\n",
    "- When memory is limited and you need dynamic allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Not ideal for:\n",
    "- Frequent random access to elements\n",
    "- Binary search operations\n",
    "- When cache performance is critical\n",
    "- Small, fixed-size datasets\n",
    "\n",
