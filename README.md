# Leetcode Labs

Coursework designed to help all experience levels solve leetcode problems. They are all based on 3-week coursework with 6 hour days of studying. It's intense, but _you can do it_!

- `\coursework` has various guides that correspond to the experience levels of the engineer and increase in difficultly

  - [Junior](./coursework/guide-junior.md)
  - [Senior](./coursework/guide-senior.md)
  - [Elite](./coursework/guide-elite.md)

- `\resources` has general guides for algorithms and data structures.

## Generating New Problems

Put notebook info in `bin\notebook.yaml` file.

```console
deno task notebook (or notebook:override)
```

# Cheatsheets

- If you only have [2 days](./coursework/2day-cheatsheet.md) to study.

- If you have [6-8 weeks](./coursework/full-cheatsheet.md) you can to maximize your ROI.

- [Common algorithm and data structure templates](./coursework/algo-template-cheetsheet.md) for problems.

# Trivia

If you [interested](./coursework/trivia.md) on how these algorithms and data structures developed.
