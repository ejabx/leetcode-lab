# Leetcode Mastery

Coursework designed to help all experience levels solve leetcode problems. They are all based on 3-week coursework with 6 hour days of studying. It's intense, but _you can do it_!

The project has various jupyter notebook folders that correspond to the experience levels of the engineer and increase in difficultly:

- [Foundational](./coursework/foundational.md)

  > This 3-week guide provides a realistic path to strong medium problem proficiency and introductory hard problem capability. The key is consistent daily practice with deep focus on pattern mastery rather than problem volume.

- [Senior](./coursework/senior.md)

  > This intensive 3-week program is designed for senior engineers who want to rapidly master algorithmic problem-solving.

- [Elite](./coursework/elite.md)
  > With this elite preparation level, you'll be ready for the most challenging technical interviews at any company, including quantitative trading firms, advanced AI research positions, and senior+ roles at top tech companies. Your preparation will rival computer science PhD candidates and competitive programming experts.

Also, here's [guide](./resources/patterns-and-techniques.ipynb) for general patterns and techiques for solving problems.
