# Leetcode Labs

Labwork designed to help experiencde developers consitently solve medium and hard leetcode problems.

## Generating New Problems

Put notebook info in `bin\notebook.yaml` file.

```console
deno task notebook (or notebook:override)
```

## Getting Started

1. **Assess your current level** using problems from the [ROI guide](./coursework/ROI.md)
2. **Choose appropriate study plan** based on [time available and target difficulty](#coursework)
3. **Set up your environment** with preferred IDE and timer
4. **Follow the daily schedule** consistently
5. **Use reference materials** for quick lookup during practice
6. **Track progress** using the success metrics provided
