    "## Tips for Success\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify the Pattern**: Look for keywords like \"next greater\", \"largest area\", \"maximum in window\"\n",
    "2. **Choose Stack Type**: \n",
    "   - Use decreasing stack for \"next greater\" problems\n",
    "   - Use increasing stack for \"largest area\" problems\n",
    "3. **Store Indices**: Usually more useful than storing values directly\n",
    "4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Empty arrays, single elements, all same elements\n",
    "5. **Process Remaining Elements**: Don't forget elements left in the stack\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with basic \"Next Greater Element\" problems\n",
    "2. Move to histogram and area problems\n",
    "3. Practice with circular arrays and sliding windows\n",
    "4. Combine with other techniques (DP, binary search) for advanced problems\n",
    "\n",
    "The monotone stack is a powerful technique that can transform O(nÂ²) brute force solutions into elegant O(n) algorithms. Master this pattern and you'll be well-equipped to handle a wide range of LeetCode problems!"
