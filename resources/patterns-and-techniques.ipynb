    "- Use the common template:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while right < len(s):\n",
    "    # Expand window\n",
    "    right += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    while window is invalid:\n",
    "        # Shrink window\n",
    "        left += 1\n",

    "```python\n",
    "while stack and condition:\n",
    "    stack.pop()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## Bonus: Flashcard Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** When is the two-pointer technique most effective?  \n",
    "**A:** When working with sorted arrays or problems that involve finding pairs, triplets, or quadruplets with a target sum. Useful for reducing O(n²) to O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** How do you avoid duplicates in 3Sum or 4Sum?  \n",
    "**A:** Sort the array, and skip repeated elements using conditions like `if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]: continue`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** What’s the strategy behind the Container With Most Water problem?  \n",
    "**A:** Use two pointers at both ends and move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sliding Window\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** What is the basic sliding window pattern?  \n",
    "**A:** Expand the window by moving the right pointer, then shrink it from the left when the window becomes invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** How do you track character frequencies in string sliding window problems?  \n",
    "**A:** Use a `Counter` or dictionary to store character counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Which data structure optimizes sliding window maximum?  \n",
    "**A:** A monotonic deque (stores indices in decreasing value order).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prefix/Suffix Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** What kind of problems are prefix/suffix arrays good for?  \n",
    "**A:** Problems that require computing results over a range or excluding the current element, like \"Product of Array Except Self\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** How is prefix/suffix used in Trapping Rain Water?  \n",
    "**A:** Precompute `leftMax` and `rightMax` arrays to find the min boundary height at each index.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monotonic Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** What type of problems use monotonic stacks?  \n",
    "**A:** Problems involving the next greater or smaller element, histogram max area, and element ordering with constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** What is the monotonic stack invariant for Daily Temperatures?  \n",
    "**A:** Maintain a stack of indices where temperatures are in decreasing order. Pop when the current temp is higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** How does `Remove Duplicate Letters` use a stack?  \n",
    "**A:** It maintains a stack for result chars, a set for `seen`, and a map for remaining character counts. Pop from stack if a smaller character appears and the top can still appear later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Greedy Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** When is greedy a good strategy?  \n",
    "**A:** When local optimal choices lead to a global optimal solution — often in problems involving max area, min length, or lexicographic order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** What greedy rule is applied in `Remove Duplicate Letters`?  \n",
    "**A:** Always keep the smallest lexicographical character while ensuring all characters still appear later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus: Concept Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** How do you decide between prefix sums and sliding window?  \n",
    "**A:** Use prefix sums when you're making repeated range queries; use sliding window when working with dynamic subarrays under constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** What’s a common pattern in monotonic stack problems?  \n",
    "**A:** While the stack is not empty and the current value breaks the monotonic condition, pop from the stack.\n"
