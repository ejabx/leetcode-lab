    "# Prefix/Suffix Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Prefix and Suffix Arrays?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prefix arrays** and **suffix arrays** are powerful preprocessing techniques that allow us to answer range queries and solve array-based problems efficiently. Instead of recalculating values repeatedly, we precompute cumulative results to achieve optimal time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prefix Arrays\n",
    "A **prefix array** stores cumulative values from the beginning of the array up to each index:\n",
    "- `prefix[i] = arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[i]` (for prefix sum)\n",
    "- `prefix[i] = arr[0] * arr[1] * ... * arr[i]` (for prefix product)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suffix Arrays\n",
    "A **suffix array** stores cumulative values from each index to the end of the array:\n",
    "- `suffix[i] = arr[i] + arr[i+1] + ... + arr[n-1]` (for suffix sum)\n",
    "- `suffix[i] = arr[i] * arr[i+1] * ... * arr[n-1]` (for suffix product)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Prefix/Suffix Arrays?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity Benefits:**\n",
    "- Range queries: O(n) → O(1)\n",
    "- Multiple subarray calculations: O(n²) → O(n)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Common Use Cases:**\n",
    "- Range sum/product queries\n",
    "- Subarray problems with specific constraints\n",
    "- Finding elements that satisfy relative conditions\n",
    "- Matrix operations (2D prefix sums)\n",
