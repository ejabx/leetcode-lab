## Study Strategy & Time Management

### Time Allocation Framework

- **Easy problems**: 20-30 minutes

  - 5 min: Read and understand
  - 10-15 min: Implement
  - 5-10 min: Test and optimize

- **Medium problems**: 35-60 minutes

  - 8 min: Read, understand, plan approach
  - 20-35 min: Implement
  - 7-15 min: Test, debug, optimize

- **Hard problems**: 60-90 minutes
  - 15 min: Read, understand, research if needed
  - 35-60 min: Implement (may need multiple attempts)
  - 10-15 min: Test, optimize, understand edge cases

### 4-Step Problem-Solving Process

1. **Solo Attempt** (Time-boxed based on difficulty)

   - Read problem carefully
   - Identify pattern/technique needed
   - Attempt implementation
   - Don't get stuck - move to next step if blocked

2. **Solution Study** (10-15 min)

   - If stuck, study optimal solution
   - Understand the approach completely
   - Note any techniques you missed

3. **Independent Implementation** (20-40 min)

   - Close the solution
   - Implement from scratch based on understanding
   - This step is crucial for retention

4. **Review & Pattern Recognition** (5-10 min)
   - Test with edge cases
   - Note the key technique/pattern
   - Connect to similar problems
