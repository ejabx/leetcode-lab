## Study Strategy & Time Management

### Time Allocation Framework

- **Easy problems**: 20-30 minutes

  - 5 min: Read and understand
  - 10-15 min: Implement
  - 5-10 min: Test and optimize

- **Medium problems**: 45-60 minutes

  - 10 min: Read, understand, plan approach
  - 25-35 min: Implement
  - 10-15 min: Test, debug, optimize

- **Hard problems**: 60-90 minutes
  - 15 min: Read, understand, research if needed
  - 40-60 min: Implement (may need multiple attempts)
  - 15 min: Test, optimize, understand edge cases

### 4-Step Problem-Solving Process

1. **Solo Attempt** (15-20 min max)

   - Read problem carefully
   - Identify pattern/technique needed
   - Attempt implementation
   - Don't get stuck - time box this

2. **Solution Study** (10-15 min)

   - If stuck, read optimal solution
   - Understand the approach completely
   - Note any techniques you missed

3. **Independent Implementation** (20-30 min)

   - Close the solution
   - Implement from scratch based on your understanding
   - This step is crucial for retention

4. **Review & Pattern Recognition** (5-10 min)
   - Test with edge cases
   - Note the key technique/pattern
   - Add to your mental pattern library

## Key Patterns to Master

### 1. [Two Pointers](../resources/two-pointer.ipynb)

- **When to use**: Sorted arrays, palindromes, target sum problems
- **Variations**: Same direction, opposite direction, fast/slow
- **Template**: Start with pointers at ends, move based on comparison

### 2. [Sliding Window](../resources/sliding-window.ipynb)

- **When to use**: Substring/subarray problems with constraints
- **Variations**: Fixed size, variable size
- **Template**: Expand window until condition violated, then contract

### 3. [DFS/BFS](../resources/graphs.ipynb)

- **DFS**: Use for path finding, backtracking, tree problems
- **BFS**: Use for shortest path, level-order traversal
- **Key**: Choose based on whether you need all paths or shortest path

### 4. [Backtracking](../resources/backtracking.ipynb)

- **When to use**: Generate all combinations/permutations
- **Template**: Make choice â recurse â undo choice
- **Optimization**: Prune early when possible

### 5. [Dynamic Programming](../resources/dynamic-programming.ipynb)

- **Identify**: Optimal substructure + overlapping subproblems
- **Approach**: Define state â find recurrence â implement (memoization or tabulation)
- **Space optimization**: Often can reduce from 2D to 1D

- [ ] Apply sliding window to string/array problems
- [ ] Recognize 80%+ of common interview patterns

### Interview Readiness Assessment

**Completing this 2-day plan provides:**

- **~75% coverage** of common interview patterns
- **Solid foundation** in the top 6 most frequent techniques
- **Pattern recognition** skills for similar problems
- **Implementation confidence** for medium-difficulty problems

### Next Steps for Further Improvement

1. **Week 2**: Focus on advanced DP (edit distance, palindromes)
2. **Week 3**: Advanced graph algorithms (Union Find, shortest paths)
3. **Week 4**: System design problems and optimization techniques

## Final Tips for Maximum Retention

1. **Code by hand first** - builds muscle memory
2. **Explain your approach out loud** - simulates interview conditions
3. **Time yourself** - builds speed and pressure handling
4. **Focus on understanding, not memorizing** - patterns transfer to new problems
5. **Review your mistakes** - most learning happens from debugging

**Remember**: The goal isn't to memorize solutions, but to recognize patterns and build problem-solving intuition that applies to new problems you haven't seen before.
